A modern, native client for [Floatplane](https://www.floatplane.com) — built from scratch for iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Android phone, Android TV, and Fire TV.

## Highlights

- **Native everywhere.** SwiftUI on Apple platforms, Jetpack Compose on Android. Not a wrapped web view.
- **Closed captions** on every platform, with system-styling support.
- **Picture-in-picture and background audio** on iPhone, iPad, and Android.
- **Watch Later, custom Playlists, and Enhanced LTT search** via a companion API.
- **Simple Floatplane OAuth login** — sign in with your Floatplane account through Floatplane's official OAuth flow; tokens are DPoP-bound to a private key in the device Keychain / Keystore so they can't be replayed if intercepted.
- **Player polish**: sleep timer, force-landscape, screen-stay-awake, playback-speed memory, tappable timestamps in descriptions, watch-progress restore, multi-part post support.
- **TV-first TV apps** for tvOS, Android TV, and Fire TV — not phone apps stretched onto a 65" screen.

## Repository layout

This is a pnpm + Gradle monorepo.

```

## Getting started

### iOS / iPadOS / tvOS

```bash
pnpm install
open apps/ios/FloatNative.xcodeproj
```

Requirements: Xcode 16.4+, iOS 17+ / tvOS 17+.

### Android / Android TV / Fire TV

Open `apps/android/` in Android Studio (Hedgehog or newer) and let Gradle sync. Min SDK 26, target SDK 36.

### Companion API

```bash
pnpm api:dev           # Cloudflare Workers local dev
pnpm api:deploy        # ship to Cloudflare
```

For the Go variant (self-hosting on a Linux box with Postgres), see [`packages/api-go/README.md`](packages/api-go/README.md).

### Regenerate API models

```bash
pnpm openapi:generate:swift    # iOS models
pnpm openapi:generate:kotlin   # Android models
pnpm openapi:generate:all      # both
pnpm openapi:update-spec       # pull latest community spec
```

Spec and generation scripts live in [`packages/openapi/`](packages/openapi/).

## Authentication & DPoP

Floatplane's V2 auth uses **DPoP (Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession)** to bind OAuth tokens to a device-held private key, so intercepted tokens can't be replayed elsewhere.

Both apps store the DPoP key in the platform's secure enclave (iOS Keychain, Android Keystore) and sign every request with a fresh proof. For HLS playback — where neither AVPlayer nor ExoPlayer can sign individual segment requests — we use a **manifest interception** strategy: a custom resource loader signs the master playlist and key requests with DPoP, then rewrites segment URIs to absolute `https://` so the player streams them natively without DPoP. The backend is designed around this split: keys require session-bound auth, segments don't.
